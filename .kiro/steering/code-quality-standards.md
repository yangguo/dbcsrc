# Code Quality Standards

## Python Code Standards (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

## Code Formatting and Linting
- Use Black for automatic code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting and organization
- Use flake8 for linting and style checking
- Use mypy for static type checking
- Use bandit for security vulnerability scanning

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive exception handling
- Use specific exception types rather than generic Exception
- Log errors with appropriate context and stack traces
- Never expose internal error details to end users
- Include proper error recovery mechanisms

## Documentation Standards
- Maintain up-to-date README files for each component
- Include API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Document environment setup and configuration
- Provide troubleshooting guides
- Include code examples and usage patterns

## Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
- Create feature branches for all new development
- Require code reviews for all pull requests
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Tag releases with proper version numbers

## Code Review Process
- Review for functionality, security, and performance
- Check for proper error handling and logging
- Verify test coverage for new code
- Ensure documentation is updated
- Validate adherence to coding standards

## Performance Considerations
- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Store secrets securely in environment variables
- Regular dependency updates and security scanning
