# Deployment Standards

## Docker Configuration
- Use multi-stage Docker builds for production optimization
- Implement proper layer caching for faster builds
- Use non-root users in containers for security
- Include health checks in Dockerfiles
- Optimize image size with minimal base images

## Environment Management
- Use separate configurations for dev/staging/production
- Store secrets in environment variables, never in code
- Validate required environment variables on startup
- Use .env files for local development
- Implement proper secret management in production

## Container Orchestration
- Use Docker Compose for local development
- Include monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Configure proper networking between services
- Implement service discovery and load balancing
- Use persistent volumes for data storage

## Production Deployment
- Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for SSL termination
- Implement proper logging aggregation
- Configure automated backups for databases
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Use container orchestration (Docker Swarm/Kubernetes)

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate testing on every commit
- Build and push Docker images on successful tests
- Implement automated security scanning
- Use blue-green or rolling deployments
- Include rollback procedures

## Monitoring and Observability
- Implement comprehensive health checks
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- Set up metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Configure alerting for critical issues
- Monitor application performance and resources

## Security Considerations
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Configure firewalls and access controls
- Regular security updates and patches

## Backup and Recovery
- Automated database backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Document disaster recovery plans
- Implement data retention policies
- Monitor backup success and integrity
